# Snowboarding Holiday Budget Calculator

## Description
This project is a single-page JavaScript application designed to calculate the budget for a snowboarding holiday. Users can input their starting budget, choose between local or overseas locations, select a budget tier (High-end, Mid, Budget), decide on equipment options (Hire or BYO), and specify trip dates. The application calculates the total expenses, net result, and provides a breakdown of costs.

## Features
- Interactive form for user inputs
- Dynamic calculation of expenses and net result
- Displays different images based on budget outcome (positive or negative)
- A fun and visually engaging theme with a snow-capped mountain background

## How to Use
1. **Unzip the Project Folder**: Extract the contents of the project folder to your desired location.

2. **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
   - Create a virtual environment by running:
     
     python3 -m venv env
     
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **On macOS/Linux**:
       
       source env/bin/activate
       
     - **On Windows**:
       
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       
   - Install any required dependencies (if applicable). This project does not require any Python dependencies but setting up the environment ensures isolation for potential future requirements.

3. **Run a Local Server**:
   - With the virtual environment active, run Python’s built-in HTTP server:
     
     python3 -m http.server
     
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

4. **Open the Application**:
   - Load the `index.html` file in your browser to start the calculator.

5. **Input Data**:
   - Fill in the form fields, choose your options, and press "Calculate."

6. **View Results**:
   - Review the total expenses, net result, and cost breakdown in the results section.

7. **Reset**:
   - Refresh the browser to reset the form.

## Notes
